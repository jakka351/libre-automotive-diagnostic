"""Transport abstraction: one interface, many backends.

A ``Transport`` carries OBD-II / UDS *service payloads* to the vehicle and returns
the responses from every ECU that answered. Each backend (SocketCAN, ELM327, an
in-memory fake, ...) hides all framing — ISO-TP segmentation, ELM327 ASCII echo,
flow control — so the protocol layer above never touches a raw CAN frame.

This is the seam that lets SocketCAN be the first-class backend while ELM327
stays alive as a secondary one, both feeding a single OBD-II/UDS service layer.
